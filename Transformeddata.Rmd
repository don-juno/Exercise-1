## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
oringin <- function(data_new) {
  # calculate the ratio---distance to speed, maybe the time 
  data_new$dist_to_speed_ratio <- data_new$dist / data_new$speed
  return(data_new)
  }
```
